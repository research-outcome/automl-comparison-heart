# AutoML Comparison for Heart Disease Diagnosis
This repository includes code to evaluate the Performance of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) Tools for Heart Disease Diagnosis and Prediction.

The code includes the usage of the AutoML tools (AutoGluon, PyCaret, and AutoKeras) for generating well-performing models on Heart Datasets. 

The codebase also includes notebooks that apply traditional machine-learning steps to generate well-performing models manually.

The datasets can be downloaded from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease
